Purpose: The purpose of this program is to simulate the experience of adopting and caring for an aged dog. Users start by naming their virtual dog and are tasked with managing its hunger, happiness, and energy levels. The ageing process is simulated, and users make daily decisions to feed, play with, rest, or even gamble for a dog prize using a slot machine. Random events, such as getting struck by a car or receiving a gift, add an element of unpredictability. The user must carefully balance the dog's attributes to prevent hunger, happiness, or energy levels from dropping to zero, leading to the dog's death. The program keeps track of user actions, random events, and daily attribute levels, offering a comprehensive summary at the end, including final scores (total days alive), statistics, and scatter plots illustrating attribute progression. After the dog dies, the user is prompted to play again or exit.
